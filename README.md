This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Booking System Setup

1. Create a Supabase project and run the SQL in `supabase/schema.sql`.
2. Enable email/password auth in Supabase and create staff user accounts.
3. Add the booking env vars to `.env.local` (see the placeholders).
4. Install new dependencies with `npm install`.

The booking form posts to `src/app/api/bookings/route.js`, which writes to Supabase and sends confirmation emails via Resend.
The admin view lives at `/admin` and uses Supabase Auth to sign in.
